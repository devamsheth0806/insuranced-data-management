# Insurance Data Storage Management
This is a C++ file and still in development.

In this project, I have implemented B+ trees and added queues to nodes of the tree. Each node of the B+tree represents the client who registered insurance and queue represents the list of policies of corresponding client.  A user can register, view, delete and modify client details and his policies.


Till now it is able to do all those tasks I mentioned earlier.

In this file, there is also a self running algorithm which shows and deletes the policies which have reached their maturity.

This is a real time program, i.e. data entered in this are not stored permanently anywhere.
